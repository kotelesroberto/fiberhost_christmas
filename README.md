# Facebook Game

Coded by Robert Koteles, Senior Frontend Developer, 2014. 
This is a game for Facebook. Around this time Facebook IFRAME was used for adding applications to the social media fan pages. For doing that FB API was used for getting user information and permissions. 

## Rules
 - User has 60 seconds to decorate a Christmas three by different fancy items.
 - Activity is interactive, after 60 seconds a popup asks user what to do: share the "artwork" on their newsfeed OR send as a message.
 - The final image to share is generated by PHP GD2 library based on collected mouse click events per decoration.
